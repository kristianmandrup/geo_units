h1. Geo Units

Distance unit functionality (conversions etc.) for Geo libraries. See specs for details.

This gem is used by the _geo_point_ and _geo_calc_ gems and perhaps by others. The aim is that it will contain most of the basic 
distance unit functionality required by typical Geo projects.

h2. Contributing to geo_units
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
